# AccessibilityDemo
**If you want to learn about accessible Android apps development, you are at the right place.**

The "Accessibility Demo" is a private project.

<h2>Vision</h2>

The vision behind the Accessibility Demo is to improve my skills as an Android developer on a real project.

<h2>Usage</h2>

The app can be used as a reference to evaluate  test tools for accessibility. The app is also intended as an example of how an  app can be made accessible.

In the app are different elements e.g image buttons ect. I have implemented each element twice - once in an accessible version and once in a  not accessible variant.
